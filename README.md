# Liam Motor App

This application is for practicing building a full stack web application. The app will be required to provide a website for customers to send enquiries to a fictional garage. The mecahnic will then be able to read enquiries from a customer and respond. The mechanic will also be able to crerate an appointment for the customer and send an invite to the appointment.
